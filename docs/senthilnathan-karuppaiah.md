## About Me

I am a seasoned hands-on Software Architect with more than two decades of experience in product engineering and solution design. My journey in the tech industry began in 1999, and over the years, I've donned various roles, including Programmer, Team Lead, and Architect. With a relentless passion for innovation and technology, I've made significant contributions to startups, large enterprises, and multinational corporations.

At present, I work as a Senior Engineering Manager at Hitachi Vantara, USA, specializing in the Pentaho Data Catalog, Product Development. In this role, I lead a global distributed team of Software Engineering professionals across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. I contribute significantly to Core Engineering, Production Engineering, Pre-Sales, and Customer Success, serving as a Developer Advocate for the Pentaho Data Catalog product suite. This suite includes Data Discovery, Data Provenance, Data Governance/Classification, Business Metadata Management, Master Data Management, and Data Quality assessment.

My deep knowledge in Data Discoveries product development involves processing petabytes of data using optimized high-performance data ingestion techniques, AI/ML, and algorithmic-based data fingerprinting and analysis. My journey has also taken me through two acquisitions, first by Centrica and then by Hitachi Vantara. This wealth of experience positions me as a versatile and adept professional ready to tackle complex data challenges and empower organizations with innovative solutions.

## Technical Prowess

My technical acumen spans a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and frameworks. From Golang, Python, NodeJS, C#, and JAVA/J2EE to front-end frameworks, I have hands-on expertise in diverse programming languages and platforms. I've delved into AWS's IaaS & PaaS stack, mastering Elastic Beanstalk, SES, S3, Lambda, EventBridge, Step, and Route53, among others. Containerization, using Docker and Kubernetes, has also been a key part of my journey.

My proficiency extends to numerous Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), ranging from legacy databases to modern data lakes and lakehouses. I've worked extensively with platforms such as Snowflake, Databricks, Object Store, and DuckDB. This comprehensive database knowledge allows me to architect robust and scalable solutions across a broad spectrum of data management challenges.

## Open-Source Contributions

I am actively involved in open-source software development and have a strong presence in the community. My contributions can be found on my GitHub profile (https://github.com/senthilsweb), where I maintain open-source projects and contribute to various codes and initiatives. My commitment to the open-source community reflects my dedication to collaborative and transparent software development.


## Global Experience

My career journey has spanned the globe, taking me from India, where I originally started my career, to the USA, Japan, Ukraine, Dubai in the Middle East, Europe, and Singapore. This international exposure has honed my ability to adapt, collaborate, and thrive in diverse cultural and business landscapes. In particular, my three-year stint in Japan allowed me to develop conversational Japanese skills, facilitating seamless cross-border communication.

## Start-Up Enthusiast

I have a fervent enthusiasm for startups and a proven track record in startup culture. As a founding team member of Io-Tahoe (earlier Rokittech), I contributed to building a successful data discovery and governance product company. We harnessed algorithmic, AI, and ML techniques to create a highly-rated product used by large enterprises, banks, healthcare institutions, and more. This journey included two acquisitions, with Hitachi Vantara being the latest, in May 2021.
