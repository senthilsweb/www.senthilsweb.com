# Building and Running AMD64 Docker Containers on Apple M1

The introduction of Apple's M1 chip, operating on the ARM64 architecture, presented developers with unique challenges. The primary obstacle was the compatibility between standard Docker images (built for x86_64 or AMD64 architecture) and the ARM-based M1 chip. Here, we dive into my personal journey of containerizing a Go application and ensuring it runs smoothly on an Apple M1 MacBook Pro.

## Problem Statement

Building and running Docker containers for applications is a daily task for many developers. Yet, architectural differences can throw a wrench in these processes. My challenge was to run a Go application in a Docker container, primarily built for the AMD64 architecture, on an Apple M1 chip. Adding to the complexity, the application relied on a configuration file residing in the same directory as the binary.



## The Journey to a Solution

### 1. Initial Hiccups

My initial attempt to use the `ubuntu:latest` image yielded compatibility error messages like:

```
qemu-x86_64: Could not open '/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2': No such file or directory
```

### 2. Cross-Platform Docker Builds

I leveraged Docker's `--platform` flag, setting it to `linux/amd64`, to build images compatible with the QEMU emulator on Docker Desktop for Mac on M1 machines.

### 3. Viper & Configuration

Using the Viper library in Go, I ensured seamless configuration management. Setting the Dockerfile's working directory and using relative paths allowed Viper to identify and utilize the configuration file effectively.

### 4. Docker-Compose for Ease of Use

Docker Compose simplified building, running, and managing the application within a Docker container. Through a `docker-compose.yml` file, I was able to establish a consistent execution environment for the application.

### Source Codes

#### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use a valid Go version
FROM golang:1.17 AS builder

# Install dependencies if any
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc

# Set your working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/org/repo

# Copy your code into the container
COPY . .

# List the contents (for debugging)
RUN ls -al

# Build the Go application
# If you're building for a different architecture, you'd set GOARCH accordingly.
RUN CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o templrgo .

# The command to run when the container starts
CMD ["/go/src/github.com/org/repo/templrgo", "-p", "8182"]
```

#### Github action for cross-platform builds

```yaml
name: Build and Push Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # or whichever branch you'd like

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v2
      with:
        go-version: 1.17 # specify the desired version

    - name: Compile Go for linux/amd64
      run: |
        GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o templrjs_server-linux-amd64

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      id: buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

    - name: Login to DockerHub
      uses: docker/login-action@v1 
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

    - name: Build and push
      id: docker_build
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        context: .
        file: ./Dockerfile
        platforms: linux/amd64
        push: true
        tags: |
          ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/templrjs:latest
          ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/templrjs:${{ github.sha }}
          ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/templrjs:build-${{ github.run_id }}
```

#### Docker compose file

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  templrjs_server:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: templrjs
    ports:
      - "5000:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app/
```
