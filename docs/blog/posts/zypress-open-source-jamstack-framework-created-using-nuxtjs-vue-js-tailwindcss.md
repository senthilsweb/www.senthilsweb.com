# Zypress, Open-source Jamstack framework created using NuxtJS (Vue.js) + Tailwindcss

Zypress is a Vue.js based Jamstack framework created using NuxtJS + Tailwindcss + @nuxt/content to rapidly build modern websites anything you can imagine. It comes preloaded with a personal website and documentaion stater-kit to power blog and documentation websites.

I got introduced to Vue.JS then to tailwindcss and Nuxt.js and immediately fell in love with the Nuxt (Vue.js) Power, Flexiblity and Easy to learn nature of the framework. Adding Tailwindcss (tailwind.UI) to Nuxt elevated the overall design, development and user experience and I decided to start building a generic high level web development framework with the following design goals and the result is zypress (inspired by the name Vuepress) which I open-sourced to the community today, 4th July 2021 and committed to work on this personal project during my weekends and free time.
